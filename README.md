## About this repo

- This repo consists of my notes of datastructures classes taught in University of ZHEJIANG on MOOC.

- Most of the code that this branch contains will be written by C/C++.

- Record C/C++ data structure exercises.

- Summarize the learning content and put forward my own understanding.

## Note style

### Code

All code will be marked \`\`\`Language ...code... \`\`\` when the lecture is read in raw format. When viewed through Github and Pandoc, it will be color coded based on the language as such:

* C
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(void){
        char * foo = "bar";
        printf("%s",foo);
        return 0;
    }
    ```
  * All C code is Compiled with ```MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1```.
